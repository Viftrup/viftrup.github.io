Hi there! My name is Dmytro Lytvyn (this is a Ukrainian name, in Russian it's Dmitry Litvin). I'm a Ukrainian database developer, born in Kharkiv and currently living in Berlin, Germany.

This blog's purpose is to put together and document my ideas and approaches to building DWH (data warehouses), ETL processes, and other relevant things. Usually, there's never enough time or interest to know how things are done within the company, but maybe this can be useful for other people. And surely, it's valuable for myself, to have my thoughts and ideas organized in a structured way.

I know how sad it is to see the abandoned and forgotten blogs, but this blog's goal is not to be my life's diary, but rather a collection of articles with ideas and best practices for BI-related subjects.

This blog is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) ([github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)).
