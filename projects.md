[DWH SQL CodeGen](https://github.com/dmytro-lytvyn/dwh-sql-codegen)

DWH SQL CodeGen is a cross-platform GUI application with a simple interface, built using Python and WxWidgets, that generates SQL scripts to build and load DWH (PostgreSQL/Redshift) from staging tables.

This application should be considered rather as a working prototype, and needs a lot of refactoring and cleaning up. Nevertheless, it's already useful in its current state, and saves the hours and days you can spend writing thousands of lines of SQL code.
